Fortune Wheel

# Notes

-   the target config file is loaded from bin/Debug/configs
-   there is an empty row of data on the very last, that can be used to create a new row by inserting some values to it
-   meanwhile, in order to delete a row, it can be done by select the very left column of the row and press "Del" button
-   in case there are some failed processes (ex: to save changes), instead of closing the window and reopen it in order to get the latest data, this can be done just by clicking the refresh button that will reload data from the target config file
-   whenever making changes, please do not forget to off the focus from the current editing area
